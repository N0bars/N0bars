Hi! I am a highschool student in the United States who just started coding and this is my first attempt in creating a GitHub readme; from hereon out I'm going to update this readme for everytime I learn something new and build experience. 

Anyhow, I am really facinated with network security and encription hence in the future I hope to work with protecting people against online attacks.
